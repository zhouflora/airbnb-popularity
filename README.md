In this project I'll be exploring a dataset of Vancouver Airbnb listings from 2023. Specifically, I will create a customer satisfaction regression model to try to predict a listing's 'review_scores_rating', as a proxy for the popularity of the listing. Airbnb could use this sort of model to recommend new listings with high potential for customer satisfaction to site browsers. Furthermore, this model could identify the factors which are most important in predicting high ratings, which hosts can then use to improve their own listings.
